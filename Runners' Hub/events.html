                    Faith Kipyegon's record-breaking streak continued with a stunning performance at the Monaco Diamond League meeting. On Friday, July 21, the Kenyan runner shattered the women‚Äôs world record in the mile, winning in 4:07.64 at Stade Louis II.

                 Along with Kipyegon, seven competitors broke their respective national records, including American Nikki Hiltz (4:16.35). And 12 runners achieved personal bests in the fastest women‚Äôs mile in history.

                    Behind pacemakers Kristie Schoffield and Winnie Nanyondo, who brought the field through 900 meters, Kipyegon led the race wire-to-wire. The two-time Olympic champion split 1:02.6 for the first 400 meters and followed the opening lap with a steady 2:04.6 for 800 meters.

                <p>Kelvin Kiptum of Kenya shattered the world record at the Chicago Marathon, running 2:00:35 and breaking the previous mark of 2:01:09 set by Eliud Kipchoge in Berlin last year.</p>

                <p>Kiptum, 23, was running in only his third marathon. As he did in his first two, he ran the second half of the race faster than the first. He ran 1:00:48 for the first half and 59:47 for the second.</p>

                <p>Benson Kipruto of Kenya, the race's defending champion, finished second in 2:04:02. Bashir Abdi of Belgium, the reigning Olympic bronze medalist, was third in 2:o4:32. From the start of his career, the world record seemed to be within Kiptum‚Äôs reach. He won his debut marathon, Valencia, in December 2022 in 2:01:53, at the time, the fifth-fastest time in history. Four months later, he topped that, winning London in 2:01:25, then the second-fastest time ever, behind only his countryman Kipchoge.</p>

                <p>Kiptum was pushed for the first 18 miles of the race by Daniel Mateiko of Kenya, who was making his marathon debut. But Mateiko, 25, had marathon experience‚Äîhe paced Kiptum in London through the first 30 kilometers (18.6 miles). Plus, he has a personal best of 58:26 for the half marathon, one of five times he has broken 59 minutes for the distance.</p>

                <p>Approaching the halfway point, the appointed pacer for Kiptum and Mateiko appeared to be struggling to keep ahead of them. He stepped off the course just before 13.1. At halfway, the chase group was 1:32 behind the leaders.</p>

                <p>Kiptum ran the 19th mile in 4:21 and quickly opened up a gap on Mateiko. Kiptum's 5K split from 30 to 35K was 13:51, putting him on world record pace. His split for the 22nd mile was 4:18. Mateiko ended up dropping out after 35K.</p>

                <p>‚ÄúThat's my strategy, 19 miles, 20, I make a move,‚Äù Kiptum said after the race. He said he never felt any discomfort during the race and felt confident from 5K on that he would set the record.</p>

                <p>At the press conference two days before the race, Kiptum wouldn't speak of the world record, saying his aim was to break the course record of 2:o3:45, set by Dennis Kimetto in 2013. But the race went out in 60:40, which would put them right about at record pace.</p>

                <p>Kiptum earns $100,000 for the victory, plus a $50,000 course record bonus.</p>

                <p>In the penultimate Diamond League competition of the year, Jakob Ingebrigtsen added another impressive performance to his career tally. On Friday, September 8, the reigning Olympic champion from Norway broke the world record in the men‚Äôs 2,000 meters at the Brussels Diamond League meeting.</p>

                <p>Following a global championship, the last few meets on the elite circuit provide opportunities for athletes to earn redemption or tackle unmet goals, and Brussels proved no different.</p>

                <p>Almost two weeks after getting beat for the 1500-meter crown and coming back to win gold in the 5,000 meters at the 2023 World Athletics Championships in Budapest, Ingebrigtsen attacked the world record in a non-traditional distance that isn‚Äôt run at global championships, but requires expert pacing. With the help of pacemaker Boaz Kiprugut, who led the field through the first 1,000 meters in 2:22.28, the 22-year-old put himself within striking distance early on.</p>

                <p>Over the last 400 meters‚Äîwhich he covered solo in 55.00 seconds‚Äîthe two-time world champion flew into the finish line with no competitors in sight. His winning time of 4:43.13 broke the previous 4:44.79 world record set by Hicham El Guerrouj in 1999. Ingebrigtsen ran about 3:48-mile pace to hit the mark.</p>

                <p>‚ÄúIt's always fun to break a record. This one qualifies as a world record and not as a world best,‚Äù Ingebrigtsen, who set a world best in the two-mile distance last June, told reporters in the mixed zone. ‚ÄúI know I was able to break this one, but I had some kind of virus ten days ago and I didn't really know how I would be feeling today. However I felt really good and ran a good race. To be honest this record wasn‚Äôt a difficult one for me. Sure, when you have to do it alone, it‚Äôs really tough, but I got great help from the pacemakers. Actually they were able to help me more than I expected.‚Äù</p>

                <p>Kicking off the meet, Addy Wiley set an all-time, all-dates collegiate best in the women‚Äôs 1500 meters. The 19-year-old who competes for Huntington University, an NAIA school in Huntington, Indiana, finished eighth in her first ever Diamond League competition. Racing against global medalists, Wiley finished in 3:59.17, smashing her previous 4:03.22 personal best set in June.</p>

                    Hosts People's Republic of China ended the athletics events at the 19th Asian Games Hangzhou on a high note as He Jie won the men's event and two other Chinese athletes collected medals in the marathon races.

                    He crossed the line first in 2 hours 13 minutes 2 seconds, 25 seconds ahead of silver medallist Han Il-Ryong from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

                    They were part of a seven-strong lead group at the 35km mark but pulled away heading into the final kilometres.

                    He's teammate Yang Shaohui took bronze after dropping Ethiopian-born Bahraini Shumi Dechasa Leche in the closing stages.

                    China's other medal came from Zhang Deshun, the silver medallist in the women's marathon.

                    Bahrain's Eunice Chebichii Chumba, already a winner this year at the Rotterdam Marathon, lived up to her pre-race favourite tag to win in 2:26:14, some 1:41 ahead of Zhang.

                    Kyrgyzstan's Sardana Trofimova took bronze.
